### Instructions to Fix the "Create Workout Day" Button Issue

1. **Add Debugging Logs to Frontend:**
   - Open `WorkoutDayForm.tsx` and modify the `onSubmit` function by adding these logs at the start:
     ```tsx
     console.log('Button clicked and form submitted!');
     console.log('Form data:', data);
     ```
   - In the `createWorkoutDay` mutation function, add these logs inside the `mutationFn`:
     ```tsx
     console.log('API Response status:', response.status);
     console.log('API Response body:', await response.text());
     ```

2. **Verify Form Submission:**
   - Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and go to the Console tab.
   - Click the "Create workout day" button and check if 'Button clicked and form submitted!' appears in the console.
   - If it doesn’t, ensure the button is inside the form with `type="submit"`. For example:
     ```tsx
     <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
       <button type="submit">Create workout day</button>
     </form>
     ```

3. **Check Form Data:**
   - If the log appears, verify the 'Form data:' output. Ensure `data.exercises` has at least one exercise and `data.progressionSchemes` has entries for each exercise.
   - If data is incomplete, check your form fields and how they’re bound (e.g., using React Hook Form).

4. **Confirm Validation and Mutation:**
   - Look for 'Validation passed, submitting data:' in the console to ensure validation succeeds.
   - Check for 'Mutation starting with data:' to confirm the mutation is called.

5. **Inspect API Request:**
   - Switch to the Network tab in developer tools and look for a POST request to '/api/workout-days'.
   - Verify the request payload matches your form data and check the response status (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for bad request).

6. **Review Back-end Logs:**
   - Check Replit’s server logs (accessible via the terminal or Replit console) for messages like 'POST /api/workout-days - Request body:'.
   - Look for errors or confirmation that the workout day was created.

7. **Verify Front-end Success Handling:**
   - If the API call is successful (status 200), ensure a success toast appears and the form resets.
   - Test the toast separately by adding a test button:
     ```tsx
     <button onClick={() => toast({ title: "Test", description: "This is a test" })}>Test Toast</button>
     ```
   - If the toast works but not on success, check if `createWorkoutDay.mutateAsync(data);` resolves correctly.

By following these steps, you should identify where the process fails and fix the button issue. If needed, adjust your form setup or API handling based on the logs.
