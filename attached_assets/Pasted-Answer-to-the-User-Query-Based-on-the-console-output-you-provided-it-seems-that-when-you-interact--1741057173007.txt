Answer to the User Query
Based on the console output you provided, it seems that when you interact with the form—such as selecting the "Barbell Shoulder Press" exercise—the form state updates correctly. The exercises array goes from empty (Array(0)) to containing one item (Array(1)), and a progression scheme is initialized for the selected exercise. However, you’ve likely noticed that clicking the "Create" button doesn’t appear to do anything—no API call is made, no success message appears, and no errors are logged. Let’s break this down and figure out why.
Understanding the Problem
The logs show:
Before selecting an exercise:
exercises: Array(0)

Form state and values are logged repeatedly, indicating the form is being rendered and updated.
After selecting "Barbell Shoulder Press":
Exercise checkbox changed: Object {exercise: "Barbell Shoulder Press", checked: true}

Initializing progression scheme for: Barbell Shoulder Press

exercises: Array(1)

progressionSchemes: Object (contents not detailed in the logs).
After clicking "Create":
No additional logs appear beyond the repeated "Form state" and "Current form values" outputs.

No indication of an API call, success, or failure.
This suggests that the form is updating its state as expected when you interact with it, but the submission process—triggered by the "Create" button— isn’t happening. The most likely issue is that the button isn’t properly triggering the form’s onSubmit function.
Diagnosing the Issue
Here’s what we can infer and check:
Button Configuration:
The logs don’t show any output from an onSubmit function, even though the form state is logged multiple times after the button is clicked (implied by your context). This indicates that the onSubmit function isn’t being called.

If the button has an onClick handler logging "Create button clicked" (not explicitly shown in your logs but suggested by typical debugging patterns), but no subsequent logs from onSubmit, the button might not be set up to submit the form.
Form Submission Setup:
In a typical React form (especially with libraries like React Hook Form), the button should be a <button type="submit"> inside a <form> element, and the form should have an onSubmit handler. If the button is outside the form or lacks type="submit", it won’t trigger the form submission.
Next Steps in the Code:
If onSubmit were called, you’d expect logs from validation checks or the mutation (e.g., createWorkoutDay.mutateAsync), followed by an API request visible in the browser’s Network tab. The absence of these suggests the process stops before reaching that logic.
Most Likely Problem
The "Create" button is not correctly configured to trigger the form’s submission. It might:
Lack type="submit".

Be outside the <form> tags.

Have an onClick handler that doesn’t properly invoke the form’s submit function, bypassing the intended submission flow.
Most Effective Resolution
To fix this, ensure the button is set up to submit the form correctly and add a log to confirm that onSubmit is triggered. Here’s how:
Check and Fix the Form/Button Setup:
Ensure the button is inside the <form> element and has type="submit". For example:
tsx
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
  {/* Form fields like dayName, exercises, etc. */}
  <button type="submit">Create</button>
</form>
If you’re using React Hook Form, handleSubmit is provided by the library and wraps your onSubmit function. If not, you can use onSubmit={onSubmit} directly.
Add a Log to onSubmit:
Modify your onSubmit function to log when it’s called:
tsx
const onSubmit = (data) => {
  console.log("onSubmit called with data:", data);
  // Existing submission logic, e.g., validation or mutation
};
Test and Verify:
Click the "Create" button after selecting an exercise.

Check the console:
If you see "onSubmit called with data:" followed by the form data (e.g., { dayName: "Day 2", exercises: ["Barbell Shoulder Press"], ... }), the submission is triggering, and the issue lies in the validation or mutation logic.

If you don’t see this log, the button isn’t triggering the form submission, confirming the setup needs correction.
Implementation Example
Assuming you’re using React Hook Form (common with useMutation setups), your code in WorkoutDayForm.tsx should look something like this:
tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

function WorkoutDayForm() {
  const { handleSubmit } = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      dayName: "Day 2",
      exercises: [],
      displayOrder: 1,
      progressionSchemes: {},
    },
  });

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log("onSubmit called with data:", data);
    // Add your mutation or API call here, e.g.:
    // createWorkoutDay.mutateAsync(data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      {/* Form fields: dayName input, exercise checkboxes, etc. */}
      <button type="submit">Create</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default WorkoutDayForm;

Additional Debugging (If Needed)
If onSubmit is Called:
Add logs in your validation logic or before the mutation call (e.g., console.log("Calling mutation with:", data);) to ensure the process continues.

Check the browser’s Network tab for an API request. If none appears, verify the mutation setup and backend server status.
Backend Check:
Ensure your backend server is running and the API endpoint (e.g., /api/workout-days) accepts POST requests with the expected data structure.
Conclusion
The console output shows the form updates correctly when you select an exercise, but the lack of further action after clicking "Create" points to a form submission issue. By ensuring the button is a type="submit" inside the form and adding a log to onSubmit, you can confirm and fix the problem. Apply the changes above to WorkoutDayForm.tsx, test again, and you should see the submission process proceed as intended.
