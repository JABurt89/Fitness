Addressing the Issue: "Create" Button Not Triggering Form Submission
Based on the console output you provided, it appears that your form in WorkoutDayForm.tsx is behaving correctly when you interact with it—such as selecting the "Barbell Shoulder Press" exercise—but clicking the "Create" button doesn’t seem to do anything. There’s no API call, no success message, and no errors logged. Let’s resolve this step-by-step.
What the Logs Tell Us
Before selecting an exercise:
exercises: Array(0) (empty array)

The form state and current values are logged repeatedly, showing the form is rendering and updating as expected.
After selecting "Barbell Shoulder Press":
Exercise checkbox changed: Object {exercise: "Barbell Shoulder Press", checked: true}

Initializing progression scheme for: Barbell Shoulder Press

exercises: Array(1) (now contains one item)

The form state updates correctly with the selected exercise.
After clicking "Create":
No new logs appear beyond the repeated "Form state" and "Current form values" outputs.

There’s no indication of form submission, such as an API call or a success/error message.
This suggests that while the form’s state updates work fine, the "Create" button isn’t triggering the form’s submission process.
The Problem
The most likely issue is that the "Create" button isn’t properly configured to submit the form. Here’s why this might be happening:
Button Type:
If the button lacks type="submit", it won’t trigger the form’s onSubmit handler by default.
Button Placement:
If the button is outside the <form> element, it can’t submit the form.
Form Handler:
If the <form> element doesn’t have an onSubmit handler (e.g., via React Hook Form’s handleSubmit), the submission won’t occur.
Since no logs from an onSubmit function appear after clicking "Create," the submission process isn’t being initiated.
Solution
To fix this, let’s ensure the "Create" button correctly triggers the form submission and add a log to confirm it works. Here’s how:
Verify and Fix the Form/Button Setup:
Ensure the "Create" button is inside the <form> element and has type="submit".

If you’re using React Hook Form (common in modern React apps), use its handleSubmit function to wrap your onSubmit logic.
Example structure:
tsx
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
  {/* Form fields: dayName input, exercise checkboxes, etc. */}
  <button type="submit">Create</button>
</form>
Add a Log to onSubmit:
Update your onSubmit function to log when it’s called, helping you confirm the submission is triggered.
Example:
tsx
const onSubmit = (data) => {
  console.log("onSubmit called with data:", data);
  // Your existing logic, e.g., API call or mutation
};
Full Implementation Example:
Assuming you’re using React Hook Form, here’s how your WorkoutDayForm.tsx might look:
tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

function WorkoutDayForm() {
  const { handleSubmit } = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      dayName: "Day 2",
      exercises: [],
      displayOrder: 1,
      progressionSchemes: {},
    },
  });

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log("onSubmit called with data:", data);
    // Add your API call or mutation here, e.g.:
    // createWorkoutDay.mutateAsync(data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      {/* Example fields */}
      <input type="text" name="dayName" defaultValue="Day 2" />
      {/* Your exercise checkboxes */}
      <button type="submit">Create</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default WorkoutDayForm;
Testing the Fix
Apply the changes to WorkoutDayForm.tsx.

Select an exercise (e.g., "Barbell Shoulder Press").

Click the "Create" button.

Check the console:
You should see: "onSubmit called with data:" followed by the form data (e.g., { dayName: "Day 2", exercises: ["Barbell Shoulder Press"], ... }).

If you see this log, the button is now triggering the submission, and you can proceed with your API call logic.

If you don’t see the log, double-check the button’s type="submit" and its placement inside the <form> tags.
If the Problem Persists
Check onSubmit Execution:
If the log appears but no API call happens, add a log before your mutation (e.g., console.log("Calling mutation with:", data);) and verify your mutation setup (e.g., createWorkoutDay.mutateAsync).

Check the browser’s Network tab for an API request. If none occurs, ensure your backend server is running and the endpoint (e.g., /api/workout-days) is correct.
React Hook Form Usage:
If you’re using React Hook Form but not registering fields (e.g., <input {...register("dayName")} />), the form data might be empty. Ensure all fields are registered properly.
Regarding the Warning
The warning about defaultProps in react-beautiful-dnd is unrelated to the form submission issue. It’s a deprecation notice from a library you’re using (likely for drag-and-drop functionality in WorkoutDays.tsx). To resolve it:
Check if there’s an updated version of react-beautiful-dnd or a recommended alternative (e.g., @dnd-kit/core).

For now, it’s just a warning and won’t affect your form’s functionality, so you can address it separately.
Conclusion
The "Create" button isn’t triggering the form submission because it’s likely missing type="submit" or isn’t properly tied to the form. By ensuring it’s a <button type="submit"> inside the <form> element and adding a log to onSubmit, you’ll confirm the submission works. Apply the changes above, test again, and your form should submit as expected. If you need further help, share updated logs or your WorkoutDayForm.tsx code!
