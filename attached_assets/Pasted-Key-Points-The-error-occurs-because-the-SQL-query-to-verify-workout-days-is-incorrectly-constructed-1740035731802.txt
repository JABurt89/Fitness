Key Points
The error occurs because the SQL query to verify workout days is incorrectly constructed, causing it to fail to find existing records.
Fix by ensuring the database library properly handles arrays in SQL queries using ANY or IN clauses.
Steps include checking the library documentation, modifying the query, adding logging, and testing.
Understanding the Error
The "404: Workout day not found" error happens when reordering workout days on repl.it, specifically during a PATCH request to "/api/workout-days/reorder." The frontend sends correct IDs (e.g., 8 and 9), and the database contains these workout days, but the backend's SQL query fails to find them due to improper array handling.
Fixing the Issue
To resolve this, you need to ensure the SQL query in the reorderWorkoutDays function correctly checks for the workout day IDs. Here's how:
Identify Your Database Library: Determine if you're using pg, Prisma, Knex, or another library.
Check Documentation: Look at the library's documentation for how to pass arrays in SQL queries, especially for ANY or IN clauses. For example, pg documentation shows how to use parameterized queries with arrays (PostgreSQL Arrays in Node.js).
Modify the Query: Update the query to use the library's recommended method, such as WHERE id = ANY($1) with the array as a parameter, or use WHERE id IN (...) if supported.
Add Logging: Log the exact SQL query being executed to debug any syntax issues. This helps see if the array is handled correctly.
Test Again: After changes, test to ensure the error is resolved.
Try IN Clause: If ANY doesn't work, try using IN instead, as it might be simpler and less error-prone.
Surprising Detail: Array Handling Can Vary
It's surprising how different database libraries handle JavaScript arrays in SQL queries, sometimes requiring specific syntax like casting to int[] in PostgreSQL, which can lead to errors if not configured correctly.
Detailed Analysis and Steps
This section provides a comprehensive breakdown of the issue, potential solutions, and detailed steps to resolve the "404: Workout day not found" error when reordering workout days on repl.it. It includes all relevant details from the analysis, organized for clarity and depth, mimicking a professional technical report.
Background and Error Description
The error occurs during a PATCH request to "/api/workout-days/reorder" when clicking up/down buttons to reorder workout days. The frontend sends a payload like:
json
{
  "workouts": [
    {"id": 8, "displayOrder": 1},
    {"id": 9, "displayOrder": 0}
  ]
}
The database contains the workout days with IDs 8 and 9:
ID 8: "1 Shoulders", displayOrder: 0
ID 9: "2 Chest", displayOrder: 1
Despite this, the backend throws a "404: Workout day not found" error. The root cause is in the reorderWorkoutDays function in storage.ts, where an SQL query fails to verify the existence of these workout days due to improper array handling.
Root Cause Analysis
The SQL query uses sql\id = ANY(${workoutIds}), which is likely a typo in the description (intended as sqlid = ANY(${workoutIds}) using backticks for template literals). The issue is that this query does not properly convert the JavaScript array (workoutIds`, e.g., [8, 9]) into a PostgreSQL array, resulting in invalid SQL syntax. This causes the query to return no results, triggering the 404 error path, even though the records exist.
Key observations:
The query uses ANY, which is valid for PostgreSQL with arrays, but the library might not handle the array parameter correctly.
Possible issues include:
The array is passed as a string (e.g., "[8,9]") instead of a PostgreSQL array.
The library requires specific syntax for array parameters, such as casting to int[].
There might be a version or configuration issue with the database library.
Potential Solutions and Steps
To fix this, follow these detailed steps:
Identify the Database Library:
Determine which library is used (e.g., pg, Prisma, Knex). This is crucial as each has different ways to handle arrays.
Common libraries include:
pg: Node.js PostgreSQL client.
Knex: SQL query builder.
Prisma: ORM with query capabilities.
Consult Library Documentation:
Refer to the documentation for how to pass arrays in SQL queries. For example:
For pg, see PostgreSQL Arrays in Node.js, which shows using parameterized queries like WHERE id = ANY($1) with the array as a parameter.
For Knex, check Knex.js Where In Clause, which supports whereIn('id', workoutIds).
For Prisma, see Prisma Where In Clause, using where: { id: { in: workoutIds } }.
Modify the SQL Query:
Ensure the query is constructed correctly. Examples:
Using pg: SELECT id FROM workout_days WHERE id = ANY($1::int[]) with values: [workoutIds]. The ::int[] cast ensures the parameter is treated as an array of integers.
Using Knex: knex('workout_days').whereIn('id', workoutIds) handles the array automatically.
For SQL template literals (e.g., sql-template-strings), ensure the library converts the array to PostgreSQL array syntax, like sqlid = ANY(${workoutIds})` should work if configured correctly.
If using ANY, ensure the array is passed as a parameter, not interpolated directly, to avoid SQL injection and syntax errors.
Add Logging for Debugging:
Log the exact SQL query being executed to verify the array is handled correctly. For example:
In pg, use console.log(query.text, query.values) before execution.
Check if the query looks like SELECT id FROM workout_days WHERE id = ANY(ARRAY[8,9]) or WHERE id IN (8,9), which are both valid.
This helps identify if the array is being passed as a string (e.g., [8,9]) or incorrectly formatted.
Test the Function:
After modifying the query, test the reorder functionality again. Ensure the PATCH request no longer returns a 404 error and correctly updates the display order.
Try Using IN Clause:
If ANY continues to fail, try using IN instead, as it might be simpler. For example:
SELECT id FROM workout_days WHERE id IN ($1) with values: workoutIds.
Many libraries handle IN with arrays more robustly, especially with built-in methods like whereIn.
Manual Verification:
Run the query manually in a database client (e.g., psql) to verify:
Try SELECT id FROM workout_days WHERE id = ANY(ARRAY[8,9]).
Or SELECT id FROM workout_days WHERE id IN (8,9).
If these work, the issue is in the code; if not, check database data or schema.
Additional Considerations
Array Type and Casting: Ensure workoutIds is an array of numbers, not strings. Add a check: console.log(workoutIds, typeof workoutIds) to verify. If it's a string, parse it (e.g., JSON.parse(workoutIds)), but ensure it's coming as an array from the frontend.
Schema and Column Names: Verify the table name (workout_days) and column name (id) are correct, and there are no typos or schema issues.
Database Connection: Ensure the database connection is established correctly and using the expected schema.
Surprising Detail: It's surprising how array handling can vary across libraries, sometimes requiring explicit casting (e.g., ::int[]) or specific methods, which can lead to errors if not configured properly.

Notes
pg
Parameterized query with $1
WHERE id = ANY($1::int[])
Requires casting for type safety.
Knex
whereIn('id', workoutIds)
knex('workout_days').whereIn('id', workoutIds)
Handles arrays automatically, safer.
Prisma
where: { id: { in: workoutIds } }
N/A (ORM syntax)
Built-in support, less manual SQL.
sql-template-strings
Template literal with ${workoutIds}
sqlWHERE id = ANY(${workoutIds})``
Should handle arrays, check configuration.
This table summarizes how different libraries handle arrays, aiding in choosing the right approach based on your setup.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you should resolve the error by ensuring the SQL query correctly verifies the workout days using proper array handling. The key is to align with your library's documentation and debug with logging to identify any syntax issues. If problems persist, trying the IN clause or manual verification can help pinpoint the issue further.
