Let’s dive into your query about critiquing your app’s structure and suggesting how to rebuild it more efficiently while eliminating the defaultProps error you’re encountering. Based on the context I can infer—your React app with drag-and-drop functionality, routing, and data fetching—I’ll assess the current setup and propose a streamlined rebuild.
Critique of the Current App Structure
Your app seems to be built with a mix of powerful libraries:
react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop features.

wouter for routing (assuming Route and Switch align with its API).

@tanstack/react-query for data fetching.

Various providers (e.g., QueryClientProvider, AuthProvider) for state management.
While this stack is robust, there are some red flags:
Deprecation Warning from react-beautiful-dnd:
The defaultProps warning in memo components stems from react-beautiful-dnd. This library hasn’t seen significant updates since 2019, and its reliance on soon-to-be-deprecated React features (like defaultProps in React 18+) signals future compatibility risks.
Potential Inefficiencies:
If your forms or components aren’t optimized, you might be facing unnecessary re-renders, especially with drag-and-drop interactions or data updates via react-query.

A complex routing setup with multiple Route and Switch components could lead to nested logic that’s hard to maintain.
Form Handling Issues:
Past struggles with form submissions (e.g., a “Create” button not working) suggest inconsistencies in event handling or form configuration, which could point to a lack of standardization.
Overall, the structure is functional but shows signs of technical debt—outdated dependencies, possible performance bottlenecks, and areas lacking consistency. I wouldn’t say it’s poorly structured, but it’s not future-proof or as efficient as it could be.
Rebuilding for Efficiency and Error Elimination
To address the defaultProps error and improve efficiency, here’s how I’d rebuild your app step-by-step:
1. Replace react-beautiful-dnd with @dnd-kit/core
Why:
react-beautiful-dnd is the source of the defaultProps warning and isn’t actively maintained. @dnd-kit/core is a modern, lightweight alternative that’s compatible with React 18+ and actively supported.
How:
Install @dnd-kit/core:
bash
npm install @dnd-kit/core
Refactor your drag-and-drop components. For example, if you have a WorkoutDays component using DragDropContext, Droppable, and Draggable, update it like this:
jsx
import { DndContext, useDroppable, useDraggable } from '@dnd-kit/core';

function WorkoutDays() {
  const { setNodeRef: droppableRef } = useDroppable({ id: 'droppable' });
  const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef: draggableRef } = useDraggable({ id: 'draggable' });

  return (
    <DndContext>
      <div ref={droppableRef}>
        <div ref={draggableRef} {...listeners} {...attributes}>
          Drag me!
        </div>
      </div>
    </DndContext>
  );
}
This eliminates the defaultProps warning and gives you a more flexible drag-and-drop system.
2. Standardize Form Handling with react-hook-form
Why:
Consistent form management prevents submission issues and improves performance by minimizing re-renders compared to uncontrolled forms or manual state management.
How:
Install react-hook-form:
bash
npm install react-hook-form
Refactor forms to use it. For instance:
jsx
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

function WorkoutForm() {
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log(data); // Handle form submission
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <input {...register('name')} placeholder="Workout Name" />
      <button type="submit">Create</button>
    </form>
  );
}
Add validation with a library like zod for robustness:
bash
npm install zod
3. Optimize Data Fetching with react-query
Why:
Fine-tuning react-query ensures efficient data fetching and reduces redundant API calls or re-renders.
How:
Configure useQuery with sensible defaults:
jsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

function Workouts() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['workouts'],
    queryFn: fetchWorkouts,
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
  });

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  return <div>{data.map((w) => <div>{w.name}</div>)}</div>;
}
Memoize components to prevent unnecessary re-renders:
jsx
const WorkoutItem = React.memo(({ name }) => <div>{name}</div>);
4. Simplify Routing with wouter
Why:
A flatter routing structure reduces complexity and improves maintainability.
How:
Consolidate routes:
jsx
import { Router, Route, Switch } from 'wouter';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/workouts" component={Workouts} />
        <Route>404 Not Found</Route>
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
Use hooks like useRoute for dynamic routing logic if needed.
5. Streamline Component Hierarchy
Why:
Reducing nesting and prop drilling makes the app easier to maintain and debug.
How:
Use a lightweight state management solution like zustand for global state:
bash
npm install zustand

jsx
import { create } from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  workouts: [],
  setWorkouts: (workouts) => set({ workouts }),
}));
Wrap providers efficiently at the root:
jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <AuthProvider>
        <Router>
          <MainApp />
        </Router>
      </AuthProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
Expected Benefits
Error Elimination: Switching to @dnd-kit/core removes the defaultProps warning entirely.

Efficiency Gains: Optimized data fetching, memoized components, and standardized forms reduce re-renders and improve performance.

Maintainability: A simpler structure with modern libraries makes future updates and debugging easier.
Conclusion
I don’t fully agree with keeping the current structure as-is due to the outdated react-beautiful-dnd and potential inefficiencies. By rebuilding with @dnd-kit/core for drag-and-drop, react-hook-form for forms, optimized react-query usage, simplified routing, and a streamlined component hierarchy, you’ll eliminate the error and end up with a faster, more maintainable app ready for the future.
