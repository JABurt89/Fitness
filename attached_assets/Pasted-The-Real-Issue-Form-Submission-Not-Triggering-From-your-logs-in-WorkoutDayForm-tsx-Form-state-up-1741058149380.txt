The Real Issue: Form Submission Not Triggering
From your logs in WorkoutDayForm.tsx:
Form state updates work: When you interact with the form (e.g., selecting "Barbell Shoulder Press"), the logs show the form state and values updating correctly:
WorkoutDayForm.tsx:246 Exercise checkbox changed: Object
WorkoutDayForm.tsx:254 Initializing progression scheme for: Barbell Shoulder Press
WorkoutDayForm.tsx:41 Current form state: Object
WorkoutDayForm.tsx:42 Current form values: Object

This confirms that your form is tracking changes as expected.

Button click registers: When you click the "Create" button, you see:
WorkoutDayForm.tsx:309 Submit button clicked

However, there’s no further indication that the form’s submission logic (e.g., an onSubmit function) is running. This is the core problem: the button click isn’t triggering the form submission.
Why This Happens
The most common reasons a submit button doesn’t trigger form submission in React are:
Button Misconfiguration:
The button lacks type="submit".

The button is outside the <form> element.
Form Handler Missing:
The <form> element doesn’t have an onSubmit handler, or it’s not set up correctly (e.g., if using React Hook Form, handleSubmit might be missing).
How to Fix It
Here’s how to resolve the issue in WorkoutDayForm.tsx:
1. Ensure the Button is Properly Configured
Make sure your "Create" button is:
Inside the <form> element.

Set with type="submit".
Example:
tsx
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
  {/* Your form fields, e.g., exercise checkboxes */}
  <button type="submit">Create</button>
</form>

If you’re using React Hook Form, handleSubmit is provided by the library to wrap your onSubmit function.
2. Define and Debug the onSubmit Function
Add a log to confirm the onSubmit function is called when the button is clicked:
tsx
const onSubmit = (data) => {
  console.log("onSubmit called with data:", data);
  // Your submission logic here (e.g., API call)
};

If you’re not using React Hook Form, you can attach it directly:
tsx
<form onSubmit={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  console.log("onSubmit called");
  // Your submission logic
}}>
  <button type="submit">Create</button>
</form>

3. Test the Fix
Save your changes, click the "Create" button, and check the console.

Expected Output: You should see "onSubmit called with data:" (or similar) alongside your form data.

If it doesn’t work:
Double-check that the button is inside the <form> tag and has type="submit".

Look for JavaScript errors in the browser console that might block execution.
Example: Full Fixed Code
Assuming you’re using React Hook Form (common in modern React apps), here’s what your WorkoutDayForm.tsx might look like:
tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

function WorkoutDayForm() {
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log("onSubmit called with data:", data);
    // Add your submission logic (e.g., API call)
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      {/* Example field */}
      <input {...register("exercise")} type="checkbox" value="Barbell Shoulder Press" />
      <label>Barbell Shoulder Press</label>
      
      <button type="submit">Create</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default WorkoutDayForm;

Why This Works
type="submit": Tells the browser to trigger the form’s onSubmit event when the button is clicked.

handleSubmit or onSubmit: Ensures your submission logic runs when the form is submitted.

Logging: Helps you verify the fix by showing when onSubmit is called.
Next Steps
After applying this fix:
Test the form submission.

If it works, replace the console.log in onSubmit with your actual logic (e.g., saving the workout day to an API).

If problems persist, check the console for errors or share updated logs for further help.
This should resolve the issue and get your form submitting as expected!
